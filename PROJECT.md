It provides actionable guidance instead of raw analytics.

## 2. Target Users (V1)

Small to mid-level Instagram creators:
- 5k–200k followers
- Post consistently
- Want growth but lack data-driven direction
- Solo creators (not agencies)

## 3. Core Problem

Influencers post regularly but do not know:
- What type of content works for their audience
- What content to reduce or avoid
- Whether their performance is improving or declining
- What to post next with confidence

and get clear guidance on what to post next."

Users provide:

- A selected goal:

  - Be more consistent

No CSV required for end users.
