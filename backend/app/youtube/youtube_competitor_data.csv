4T3YlTSWa5s,How to stay curious as a dev in the AI hype era with Sumit Saha [Podcast #205],"Today Quincy Larson interviews Sumit Saha, a software engineer and prolific teacher on YouTube. Sumit is based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where he runs a developer agency building projects for clients throughout Asia.

We talk about:
- How the hunger for learning is dying and people are increasingly drawn to shortcuts over taking the time to truly understand concepts
- Sumit's information diet and his tips for expanding your skills
- 5 key developer concepts explained like you're 5

Community news section:

1. I spent three days at the San Francisco Palace of Fine Arts recording a documentary about the world's largest collegiate hackathon. More than 3,000 student developers participated in this year's UC Berkeley Cal Hacks hackathon. Over the course of 36 hours, they built a broad array of projects, then demo'd them to judges from industry. I now present to you the finished documentary. I hope you find it both enjoyable and inspiring. (80-minute documentary): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/inside-cal-hacks-2025-36-hours-at-the-worlds-largest-collegiate-hackathon/

2. freeCodeCamp also published a new course on building your own custom Kubernetes operators and controllers from scratch. You'll learn everything from the internal architecture of Informers and Caches to advanced concepts like Finalizers and Idempotency. If you're interested in DevOps, this is the course for you. (6 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-your-own-kubernetes-operators-with-go-and-kubebuilder/

3. Learn how to select the best GPU for economically training your models and running inference workloads. This no-nonsense guide will help you understand why certain specs matter more than others. It will also help you navigate around common pitfalls when buying or renting GPUs. (35 minute read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-choose-the-best-gpu-for-your-ai-workloads/

4. Learn how to benchmark embedding models using your own custom data. This course will walk you through leveraging Vision Language Models for precise text extraction. You'll also learn how to use LLMs to generate synthetic evaluation data. Finally, you'll get exposure to the rigorous statistical tests that can help you find the best models for whatever hardware you have on hand. (4 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-benchmark-embedding-models-on-your-own-data/

5. Our song of the week: Supergroup The Power Station's 1985 hit ""Some Like it Hot"". This entire album features incredible drumming by Chic drummer Tony Thompson. And with Bass and Guitars by Duran Duran's John Taylor and Andy Taylor, the whole song has insane groove. 80s icon Robert Palmer sings and brings the texture. The guy reportedly smoked 60 cigarettes a day and paid the price a few years later, but man is his voice golden on this recording. Fun fact: Duran Duran's official site says they achieved the massive drum sound by putting mics at the top of a nearby elevator shaft. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw1t7OCESUw",2026-01-23T14:30:03Z,1515,163,16,primary

From there, he was hooked - and he discusses this with Quincy on the freeCodeCamp podcast.",2026-01-23T13:18:28Z,803,10,0,primary
I7_WXKhyGms,RAG & MCP Fundamentals – A Hands-On Crash Course,"This practical crash course teaches you to build integrated AI systems rather than standalone tools. You will first master Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to connect models to your own data for accurate, context-aware answers. Next, you will learn the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to coordinate communication and actions across multiple software components. By the end, you will know how to use RAG for knowledge and MCP for system-level coordination to create sophisticated, multi-part applications.

3PD-vQbpwA8,Inside The World's Biggest Hackathon – Full Documentary on UC Berkeley's Cal Hacks,"This documentary will introduce you to the high-energy environment of Cal Hacks 2025, the world's largest collegiate hackathon, where over 2,500 students gather at the former Exploratorium in San Francisco to build innovative projects in just 36 hours. 

Quincy Larson interviews various teams to showcase diverse creations ranging from AI-powered dance coaches and K-pop training apps to automated ""burger bots"" and deodorant-spraying robots. 

Throughout the event, participants navigate technical challenges like limited Wi-Fi while demonstrating the intense work ethic, ingenuity, and community spirit that define modern developer culture.

Cal Hacks 12.0 took place on October 24–26, 2025, at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, CA.
